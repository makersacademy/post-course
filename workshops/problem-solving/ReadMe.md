# Developing a systematic approach to problem-solving

## Goals

I can define a problem and map it to a problem type
I can break down a problem into its component parts
I can approach a problem in a systematic way

## How to approach a problem

What are some problems that you are having right now? What are some problems that you have encountered in the last day or so?

Discuss a systematic approach to solving a problem:
- What are the steps we need to take when confronted with ANY problem?
- How can we break down this problem into manageable portions?

What can we do when we don't understand a problem?

What are the resources that can help us to solve a problem?

## Exercise - problem scenarios

- Somebody tells you 'my computer isn't working, can you fix it?'
- You want to learn a new programming language
- You're in a new job and you really want to impress your boss, but you're struggling to fix a bug

## Takeaway exercise

Take on a problem of your own choosing. Ideally, a learning challenge - doesn't need to be a new language, but should be something that you're a little bit uncomfortable with.

Make a time commitment to yourself and record how you approach the problem.
