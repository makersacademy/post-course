# Web Application Architecture

## Outcomes/Objectives

- I can identify the different components of a full stack web application
- I can explain why we might structure different applications in different ways
- I can diagram how a user action gets resolved in technical terms through different bits of the stack

## Demonstration

Think about some things that you might be concerned about when building an application. Brainstorm this on the board.

## Run through some examples

- I want to read some content
- I want to list to music or watch a video
- I want to chat to somebody
- I want to search for somewhere to live
- I want to manage my time using a calendar and share that with others

Get together in teams and for each example try and draw a possible system architecture on the board. Spent about 5 minutes on this.

Talk through each of the diagrams. What is missing? What kind of design challenges might you need to overcome?

At the end, get everybody to write up 3 things that they are most unsure about on post-its. This can form the basis for future sessions.

## Homework exercise & possible presentation

Think of an application you would like to build. Put together a short presentation on how you would build it and take some questions at the end (interview practice).

Extension/practice/knowledge sharing - present to a group of active students

## Some suggested technical focuses
- Technically, where data lives - database, documents, caches, session, cookies, local storage
- Topologically, where does data live - cloud, VM, local?
- How do I know who somebody is?
- How quickly can I return information?
- How many people can access my website at the same time?
- How does a web host interpret an HTTP request?
