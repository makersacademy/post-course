# Placement Projects

## About

### What’s are we doing?

We’re going to start a long term development project on the mezzanine, with the goal of producing a usable – and potentially saleable – product that benefits the Makers community. Any Makers job-hunters more than 3 weeks past their graduation* are invited to participate.

(The 3 week rule is to encourage recent graduates to focus full-time on jobhunting. If you’re not immediately seeking a job for whatever reason and you want to participate, then this is fine too – please come chat.)

### Why are we doing it?

We want to provide an environment for graduates after the course where they have a focus for continued learning and practice.

### How does it work?

There will be a stand-up meeting/breakfast at 9.30am every Monday. If you want to participate in the project during a given week, either turn up to this stand-up or post in the project slack channel #placement-projects with the days you would like to work if you can’t make it.

We’ll co-ordinate a pairing schedule based on everybody’s desired commitment that week. If you commit to working at least 2 days on the project but are struggling to pay travel costs, Makers will refund your commute to/from Makers for the full week. This is to help you maintain a good daily routine without needing to worry about the cost of commute.
You’ll be given a ticket to work on and you’ll receive support both from peers and from a coach when required.

### Who is the customer?

The customers are Makers students and the product owner will be a coach. We’ll have product planning meetings every other Thursday at 12pm (starting from Thursday 8th March), in which graduates are invited to participate. These will set out the vision for what we’re trying to build.

### What techs will we use?

This will largely be driven by student choice, but the popular votes from speaking to a few of you seem to be Java for back end microservices and React framework for front end rendering. There will likely be opportunities to explore other techs – perhaps Go or C# - further down the line.

### What do I need to do now?

If you want to be involved, join the #placement-projects channel in Slack and come along on Monday at 9.30am.
If you want to be part of the initial product planning, come along at 12pm tomorrow in the Joy Room.
If you have any questions, come talk to me!
